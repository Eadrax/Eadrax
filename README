ABOUT EADRAX
------------
{please enter appropriate information about Eadrax project here}

IMPORTANT INFORMATION
--------------------------------
Eadrax (Wipup) has been tested with following server environments:
	Apache with PHP 5.1.2 and MySQL 5.1.30

System requirements
-------------------
* A webserver like Apache
* PHP 5.x 
* MySQL 5.1.x

DOWNLOADING AND SETTING UP EADRAX (WIPUP).
---------------------------------------

You can grab the latest copy of Eadrax project from 
http://github.com/Moult/Eadrax .

To simply download the sourcecode from the page, click on the link
that says "Download Source". In case you want to work on Eadrax
you need to know at least the basics of GIT[*1] version control system.

To check out the source from the repository on github.com , do the 
following on the command line for Unix based systems:

	$ git clone git://github.com/Moult/Eadrax.git

If all went well, you will find a folder named "Eadrax" in the 
directory where you executed the above command.

[For Windows and MAC systems, please adapt the above guide to your
respective systems for GIT.]

Setting up Eadrax.
------------------

1.	Make sure you have the copy of Eadrax in a dir which is accessible 
through your web-server. Something like http://localhost/Eadrax should
point to it. The folder where you should copy Eadrax source is most 
likely named wwwroot or something similar. You may have to look into 
your server's documentation to set this up.


2.	Make sure the following directories are writable by your webserver
(and thusly by PHP):
		a] application/cache
		b] application/logs
		c] application/tmp

3.	Setting up DATABASE

You need to create a Database named `eadrax` (or anything of your liking
in case you know what you are doing), a user `eadrax` who has all 
necessary privileges for the database `eadrax`.

The following commands for mysql should get you through the database
setup pretty smoothly.

---------
NOTE: the following mysql commands are only to guide you through the
process of setting it up quick and easy are not necessarily the most
secure way of setting  up your database. Please read MySQL documentation
if you are doing this setup in a sensitive or production environment.
Please get  the manuals here: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/index.html
---------

To create database 'eadrax' from mysql prompt, you probably need to
sign in as root (or if you can't do that, ask your system administrator
to create these for you). Assuming you have root privileges on your
mysql server:

mysql> CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS eadrax;
# http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/create-database.html

mysql> CREATE USER eadrax IDENTIFIED BY 'YOURPaSSwOrDHeRe';
# http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/create-user.html

mysql> GRANT ALL ON eadrax.* TO 'eadrax'@'localhost';
# http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/grant.html
# This line assumes that you have your mysql server on localhost. 
# If not we hope you already know what you are doing.


Import the database schema into your newly created database.
------------------------------------------------------------
The schema is in the Eadrax package in an sql file named DATABASE.

Change to the directory where Eadrax is copied or checked out (git clone'd), 
typically named 'Eadrax', unless you changed it, and type the following 
command on your command prompt:

(WARNING: what follows requires that you have a database 'eadrax' setup
and you have a user named 'eadrax' on your mysql server who can access
and create/delete/update tables in the database 'eadrax')

	$ mysql -u eadrax -p eadrax < DATABASE

hit enter after above command and enter password for user eadrax.

The above command is in the format
	$ mysql -u username -p database_name < input_sql_file

Alternatively, you may use following format at your own risk:

$ mysql -u username -pYOURPaSSwOrDHeRe database_name < input_sql_file

	#you would not be required to enter password again after this command, 
	#however your password is clearly readable in this command. So make
	#sure no one's peaking over the shoulder! 


4. Configuration files.

Files to edit:
	application/config/config.php
	application/config/database.php

Note to devs
------------
Before you edit these files, you might want to add them to .gitignore
so that you don't accidentally commit your local system's settings to
the GIT repository.
============
Following is a suggested .gitignore file you may want to place in the
folder Eadrax/

# contents of file .gitignore follow
.gitignore
.htaccess
uploads/files/*
uploads/icons/*
application/logs/*
application/vendor/pchart/Cache/*
application/config/*
# ============


Editing config.php
------------------
The file is extensively documented and self explanatory.
Typically you would not need to make any changes to this file if
you set up Eadrax to be accessible through a URL like 

	http://localhost/Eadrax

If you have it set up at something like,

	http://localhost/path/to/Eadrax

you need to change line 7 from 
	 $config['site_domain'] = $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']."/Eadrax";

to
	 $config['site_domain'] = $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']."/path/to/Eadrax";


Editing database.php
--------------------
Again, massively documented file. If you followed the above procedure
you would only need to change line 34 in this file from

	    'pass'     => 'password',

to
	    'pass'     => 'your-database-password',

Note the comma in the end of that line!

That's about it. If you did everything right, you should see the page
load at the URL http://localhost/Eadrax

Replace localhost with your domain name or IP in case you are working
with a remote server.
