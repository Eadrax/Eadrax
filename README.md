# Installing Eadrax

There are two versions of Eadrax you can get:

  * **develop** - recommended for developers but still in development.
  * Alternatively, grab **master** - latest "live" stable version (used by
    http://wipup.org). Note that this is no longer supported - to install
    master, please read their README instructions instead.

# Developer Information

After following the installation instructions above, set up the development
environment as follows:

1. Get [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) `curl -s
   http://getcomposer.org/installer | php` and then run `php composer.phar
   install --dev`. This is needed to set up testing tools (installs into
   `bin/`).
2. Use [Phing](http://www.phing.info/) to run `phing all` in project root. This
   will run `phpspec`, `phpcs`, `pdepend`, `phpmd`, `phpcpd`, `phpdcd`
   and `phpdoc2`. For more information, see `phing -projecthelp`
3. Start developing. Specs are in `spec/`, documentation is in `docs/`. Any
   build logs generated by `phing all-log` useful for CI can be found in
   `build/`. Finally, use `phing` as a shorthand way to run all tests.

That's it! Leave the codebase cleaner than when you found it.
