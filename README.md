# About Eadrax-develop

This branch aims to rewrite Eadrax with the following major changes.

## Feature updates

 * Improved project privacy settings
 * Separation from project and category assignments
 * Added "highlights" pick for updates
 * Sortable WIPSpaces (to allow for many projects)
 * Revitalise the API and separate delivery mechanism to prepare for native apps
 * Improved discover feature from random to feature
 * Remove the group blog idea
 * Remove collaborative projects (may return later)
 * Remove OpenID signin (may return later)
 * Service Hooks for RSS, Github, forum software (?)
 * Custom views for multiple attachment updates, single-sentence updates,
   pastebin updates and sound updates.
 * Responsive webdesign
 * Redesign with new logo
 * Switch from BBCode to Markdown

## Switch to MIT license

More permissive, well-known, and doesn't make your brain explode.

## Use best practices

I was guilty of code rot.

# System Requirements

 * PHP >= 5.3.3

The following are unconfirmed requirements for the develop branch. If you
encounter bugs, ensure you satisfy these.

 * Apache >= 2.2
 * MySQL >= 5.0
 * ffmpeg >= 0.6 (needed for video features)
 * ffmpeg-php >= 0.6 (needed for video features)
 * diff >= 2.8.0 (needed for revision features)
 * PEAR Text\_Diff >= 1.1.1 (needed for inline revision features)
 * An RPX API key by Janrain's OpenID services. (needed for OpenID features)

The most recent packages are recommended.

# Installing Eadrax

You can grab the latest copy of Eadrax project from
http://github.com/Moult/Eadrax
  * **develop** - recommended but unstable. Clone head and then pull all git
    submodules via `git submodule update --init --recursive` in project root.
  * Alternatively, grab **master** - latest "live" stable version (used by
    http://wipup.org).  Note that this is no longer supported - to install
    master, please read their README instructions instead.

Files in src/ are PSR-0 compatible.

_As of writing Eadrax-develop is still far from complete. So if things are
broken, it's probably because they actually are._

# Developer Information

After following the installation instructions above, set up the development
environment as follows:

1. Get [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) `curl -s
   http://getcomposer.org/installer | php` and then run `php composer.phar
   install --dev`. This is needed to set up testing tools (installs into
   `bin/`).
2. Use [Phing](http://www.phing.info/) to run `phing all` in project root. This
   will run `phpspec`, `phpcs`, `pdepend`, `phpmd`, `phpcpd`, `phpdcd`
   and `phpdoc2`. For more information, see `phing -projecthelp`
3. Start developing. Specs are in `spec/`, documentation is in `docs/`. Any
   build logs generated by `phing all-log` useful for CI can be found in
   `build/`. Finally, use `phing` as a shorthand way to run all tests.

That's it! Leave the codebase cleaner than when you found it.
