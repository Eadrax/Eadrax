	Why should I use WIPUP?

WIPUP is a way to conveniently <strong>share</strong>, <strong>critique</strong> and <strong>track progress</strong> on your projects.
</p>

<p>
Given the mix of solutions used before such as work-in-progress forum threads, blog posts, mailing lists and  microblogging, WIPUP was specifically built to answer the question "what's new?". WIPUP is not about showcasing the finished creation - it's about showcasing the processes behind it: the different ideas, the development, and things that didn't quite work out in the end.
</p>

<p>
Take a few seconds to put your current project online on WIPUP. Be it a screenshot, photograph, or even just text, go and share it with friends - you'll be surprised at how much insight you may gain.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; color: #000; text-shadow: 0px 1px 0px #CCC;">
WIPUP is for people who make stuff. People who constantly have ideas bouncing around, juggle their time between various projects and start more than they finish.
</p>

<p>
Whether you just want to look back to see how far you've gone or if you want a central place for others to keep up to date, WIPUP is designed to be flexible to match your workflow - from private usage to collaboration. As such, a WIP update can be everything from a single sentence to a full page of text, complete with formatting, images, video and downloadable files.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Once an WIP update is online, anybody can add comments or kudos the update. They can subscribe to your project and track your activity. All of these statistics is presented to you on your dashboard along with a newsfeed to keep up to date on other projects.
</p>

<p>
Best of all, WIPUP is completely free to use and is open-source software. So if you find something you don't quite like, give us a shout. The more you complain, the better it'll be.

It's time to stop placing  so much emphasis on the finished product and instead appreciate the  beauty of the journey behind it.
