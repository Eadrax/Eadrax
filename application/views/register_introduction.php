	It's pretty simple to see how things work on the site. <strong>You navigate using the icons on the top:</strong>
</p>

<ul class="list" style="list-style: none;">
	<li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
		<strong>The Dashboard</strong><br />
		This appears as a link on the right as soon as you log in.<br />
		Here is where you update your settings, view your feeds, statistics and logs, and customise the site to your liking.
	</li>

	<li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
		<img src="<?php echo url::base(); ?>images/profile.png" width="40" height="87" style="margin-right: 7px; margin-bottom: 5px;" class="icon" alt="Profile" />
		<strong>Your Profile</strong><br />
		This is your public page that everybody can see online. It will show your projects and thumbnails of your progress.
	</li>

	<li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
		<img src="<?php echo url::base(); ?>images/update.png" width="40" height="87" style="margin-right: 7px; margin-bottom: 5px;" class="icon" alt="Upload" />
		<strong>Add an Update</strong><br />
		Update a project, upload a file, or even pastebin from here to find it instantly organised within your projects and ready to share.
	</li>

	<li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
		<img src="<?php echo url::base(); ?>images/random.png" width="41" height="87" style="margin-right: 7px; margin-bottom: 5px;" class="icon" alt="Browse" />
		<strong>Browse Random Files</strong><br />
		Whenever you're bored, just click this to be brought to a random file, ready for you to see what others are up to.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	We recommend updating your profile, creating a project, then start adding updates like there's no tomorrow!
