	A personal note from Dion Moult, creator of WIPUP, the Eadrax project, and current owner of WIPUP.org:
</p>
<p>
Dear all who use WIPUP.org, WIPUP, Eadrax, or the rest of the monikers that represent this web application,
</p>
<p>
WIPUP was originally coded as a closed-source application to solve a personal problem of mine - the non-existence of a capable platform to document and share my works-in-progresses with the world. As I found it particularly useful, I opened the source to bring the same benefit and joy I experienced to others. I am not a lawyer. I am a person, and by making WIPUP available I wish for you to view WIPUP as a service, an ambitious project, and the result of a person's hard work and love rather than a faceless product.
</p>
<p>
As such, the legalese below is purely for my own protection against those who don't share this view. I hope you enjoy WIPUP, and choose to help rather than hinder its growth.
</p>
