	WIPUP.org, like the name, is a work-in-progress - it is continuously changing. The code behind WIPUP is an open-source project going by the name of The Eadrax Project. Thus, contributing to Eadrax would be contributing to WIPUP.org. You don't even need to have technical know-how to contribute to WIPUP.org.
