	WIPUP.org, like the name, is a work-in-progress - it is continuously changing. The open-source system that WIPUP runs on is called Eadrax, as the project began before the name WIPUP was picked.
</p>

<p>
	We invite any and all people who want to contribute to do so. Technical knowledge is an added bonus, but is not a requirement.
</p>

<p>
	If interested, you can find more details on the <a href="https://www.assembla.com/spaces/eadrax/">Eadrax project space</a>. It contains a wiki, a ticketing system (for bugs, feature requests, etc), and more information about the project.
