	WIPUP.org, like the name, is a work-in-progress - so if you feel like you want to shape its future, then join in the fun and contribute. Technical ability is a bonus, but not a requirement.

	If interested, you can find more details on the <a href="https://www.assembla.com/spaces/eadrax/">Eadrax project space</a>. It contains a wiki, a ticketing system (for bugs, feature requests, etc), and everything you need to know about the project.
